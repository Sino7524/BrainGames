# BrainGames
This repository contains the very first game I've ever programmed, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. As you explore this project, you'll notice that it reflects my early efforts, complete with stinky code and various beginner programming techniques.

While I recognize that the code may not adhere to best practices, this project is a testament to the learning process and the challenges I faced as I embarked on my programming adventure. Every line of code represents a lesson learned, and I hope to illustrate my growth and development over time.

As you navigate through the game, you might encounter quirky logic and unconventional solutionsâ€”elements that highlight my enthusiasm and creativity, even if they sometimes lead to inefficiencies. This experience has been invaluable in shaping my understanding of software development and has motivated me to improve my skills.

I genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding as you review this early work. Your feedback is welcome, as it will help me continue to refine my craft and strive for better programming practices in future projects. Thank you for joining me on this journey!
